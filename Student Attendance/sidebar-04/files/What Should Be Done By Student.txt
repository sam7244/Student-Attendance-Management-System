1. As per the time table given to watch the video that should be followed
2. for example : python for data science- class1, you should watch the video, understand, notedown questions if 
you did not understood, discuss eachother, all these should be done befor the class1 not after the class.
3. Now teaching method has been changed, first you people has to workout and then in virtual class its only discussion about the same topic which is assigined to class1.
4. After completing the class1, on same topic quiz or any assignment will be given and that should be submitted by you.
5. whatever the links shared in the group check the link and notedown the key highlights which is related to your syllabus topics.
6. Most of the studing will be done throug e-learning, so you need to adopt to new changes.
7. For googlemeet class everyone should attend, for attendance google form will be shared, if you are not attending the live class and filling the form for those students it will be marked as absent.
8. Now you are responsible for what you are doing before the class and you are accountable for what you have done after the class.
9. We are humans every thing is possible if we plan and workout on that plan, prepare yourself your own time table schedule time what should be done and when should be done(its 
not only for your classes its also for your personel work).
